# Multiple Effect Model for Rosmann Sales Prediction
Designed a Fixed Effect and Random Effect Model for Rosmann Sales Prediction  which is for Kaggle Prediction Competition. Have Infused in various effects like fixed effects and random effects. Looked at various predictors which are influential for predicting the sales.

 CORE HYPOTHESIS 
 • If the promotional offers last more than a day, the sales will be relatively higher as compared to a single day promotion. 
 • If the promotional offers last more than a day, the number of customers will be relatively higher as compared to a single day promotion.   • If the assortment type is “Extended” (“type c”), with promotional offers will result in higher sales as compared to “Basic” (“type a”)  and “Extra” (“type b”). 
 • If the assortment type is “Extended” (“type c”), the number of customers would be more when there are promotional offers, as compared to “Basic” (“type a”) and “Extra” (“type b”). 
 Checked for different OLS assumptions and thats the reason why switched to Multiple effects model and infused various parameters for predicting models.
